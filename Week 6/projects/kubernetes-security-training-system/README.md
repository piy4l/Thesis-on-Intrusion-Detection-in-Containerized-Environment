# PROJECT BRIEF - Kubernetes Security Training System

Take a look at the **[Vision Statement](https://github.com/cncf/financial-user-group/blob/master/projects/kubernetes-security-training-system/Vision-statement.md)** for details of the training system and the reasons behind its creation.  The project itself has now been moved to a new dedicated location, take a look at <https://github.com/kubernetes-simulator/simulator> for more details.

## Main Project Page
This project has moved to <https://github.com/kubernetes-simulator/simulator>

## Description

This solution aims to provide users with a hands on approach to Kubernetes security training.  The system will provide a segregated training environment with the ability to select and load training exercises into the system.  The exercise will require the user to either mitigate a potential threat in the cluster or attack a cluster with the aim of gaining an understanding of the underlying principles.

## Next Steps

* Phase 1 (COMPLETE) - System will be deployed into a cloud environment.  Exercise can be chosen from selection of 5 exercises
* Phase 2 (COMPLETE) - Mitigation exercises, Additional 20 exercises
* Phase 3 (TBD) - Multi player capability (Blue team, forensics, red team)
